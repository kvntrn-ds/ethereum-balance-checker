# ethereum-balance-checker
My first working Web3 frontend!

## What It Does
- Connects to MetaMask
- Shows your wallet address
- Displays current network (Mainnet, Sepolia, etc.) and Chain ID
- Queries and displays your ETH balance (rounded to 4 decimals)
- Has a Refresh button to update balance without reconnecting
- Shows loading state

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (preferably with Live Server in VS Code)
2. Click "Connect MetaMask"
3. Approve the connection
4. See your live balance

## Software used
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- ethers.js v6 (via CDN)
- MetaMask browser wallet
